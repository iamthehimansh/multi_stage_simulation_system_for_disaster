// This shader's purpose is to render a mesh's world-space normals as colors.
// It's a fundamental part of the billboard generation process, as the output
// texture from this shader becomes the billboard's normal map, allowing it to
// react to lighting as if it had 3D surface detail.
// This .shader file itself is primarily a structural wrapper; the actual
// graphics calculations are performed in the included HLSL file.

// The path "Hidden/..." ensures this shader does not appear in the standard
// material shader selection dropdowns, as it's an internal tool shader.
